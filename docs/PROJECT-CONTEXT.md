# Project Context - windowsweep

Last Updated: 2026-09-03
Verified Against: commits ac72188 and 70c6738 on `main`, 2026-09-03 (1.0.0 release)

## Identity and outcome
- Purpose: safe, developer-aware disk and cache cleanup CLI for Windows; the Windows member of the family with
  `linux-cleanup` (Bash) and `macleanup` (Bash).
- Primary users: developers and power users on Windows 10/11 who want to see and control every deletion.
- Current status: 1.0.0 released; public GitHub repo `aoneahsan/windowsweep`; published on npm as `windowsweep`.
- Distribution: `npx windowsweep`, `npm install -g windowsweep`, or a clone run through `windowsweep.cmd`.

## Chosen architecture
- Runtime: Windows PowerShell 5.1-compatible scripts (also run on PowerShell 7), dot-sourced `lib/` + `modules/`,
  flags parsed from `$args` (no `param()` on the entry so GNU-style flags survive `-File`).
- Launcher: `bin/windowsweep.js` (Node >=14, zero dependencies) spawns `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`;
  `windowsweep.cmd` does the same without Node. Both pass version/launcher facts via `WINDOWSWEEP_*` env vars.
- State: `%USERPROFILE%\.windowsweep\{logs,reports,feedback,config.json}`; JSON report schema 1; MD/HTML export
  built in (no jq).
- Deployment: GitHub (`main`, remote `o`) + npm; CI job `ci` on `windows-latest` runs self-test + dry-run on both
  hosts, PSScriptAnalyzer, and a tarball allowlist sweep.
- Deliberate stack deviations: no TypeScript, no yarn build, no Vitest; the gate is `--self-test` (fixture-based)
  plus `--dry-run`. Source is ASCII-only because PowerShell 5.1 reads BOM-less UTF-8 as ANSI.

## Durable owner decisions
- Name `windowsweep` (windows + sweep sharing the s, the macleanup construction); chosen 2026-09-03 after two
  rounds of candidates; verified free on npm (incl. `window-sweep`) and unclaimed by any real product.
- npm publish of 1.0.0 approved by the owner on 2026-09-03 "to secure the spot"; token comes from the FilesHub
  developer-accounts vault (`aoneahsan-npm-pat`), never stored in the repo.
- Author block carries name, site, GitHub, LinkedIn and the public email only; no phone number (2026-09-03).
- Section numbers 0-21 are frozen from 1.0.0; a retired section stays as a no-op.
- Developer mode semantics (owner requirement): developer = idle gate (100 days) + keep-newest on sections 1-5;
  non-developer = clear those caches. Non-interactive with no saved answer defaults to developer on.
- Idle age = newest of write/access/creation time, because Windows disables last-access updates on most
  volumes; the rule may only make files look fresher (conservative). Accepted trade-off 2026-09-03.
- Personal sections (17, 18, 19) are interactive-only and use the Recycle Bin; Downloads is the only personal
  root scanned; Desktop stays a protected root.
- Prefetch, `Windows\Installer`, WinSxS (except via DISM), NTUSER/UsrClass, hiberfil (except via powercfg) are
  never touched by design.
- On the owner's machine (2026-09-03): hibernation to be disabled fully (`--hiberfil off`) in the admin step;
  the real run in the build session covered the safe batch in developer mode only.
- The repo folder on the build machine stays `D:\work\windows-cleanup` until the owner renames it
  (renaming the working directory mid-session breaks the session).

## Constraints and non-goals
- Must: honour `--dry-run` in every destructive helper and external command; route every deletion through
  `Remove-PathSafe` / `Send-ToRecycleBin` with a declared `-Within` root; keep every file under 500 lines;
  keep source ASCII-only; make no network calls; ship only the `files` allowlist.
- Must not: add dependencies; follow reparse points; delete inside a protected root under any flag; auto-run
  deep or interactive sections in batch mode; store credentials or machine-specific paths in the repo.
- Explicitly out of scope: registry cleaning, startup-item management, driver or service changes, undo for
  caches, a GUI.

## Key paths and contracts
- `lib/safety.ps1` - the chokepoint and the protected lists; every change here is a safety change.
- `lib/constants.ps1` - section catalogue, profiles, safe batch, version fallback (must equal `package.json` and `VERSION`).
- `lib/actions.ps1` - `New-Target` rows + `Invoke-TargetList`; the cache-folder name allowlist for layout kinds.
- `modules/release_helpers.ps1` - the self-test (108 checks incl. junction, dry-run, keep-newest, extension fixtures).
- `docs/sections.md`, `docs/cli-reference.md`, README section table - must agree with the catalogue.

## Verification
- Standard gates: `node bin/windowsweep.js --self-test --no-color` (exit 0), `npm run version:check`,
  `npm pack --dry-run` shows only the allowlist, `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Recurse -Settings PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1`
  (0 findings).
- Runtime verification: `--dry-run --all --yes --developer` reviewed section by section before any real run;
  CI repeats self-test + dry-run on Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.
- Gate proof (2026-09-03): two planted defects of different shapes each turned `--self-test` red (exit 1) -
  a protected path declared as a section 9 target (check [6]) and an unclosed function in a module (check [3]);
  both removed, files byte-identical, 108/108 again.

## Real run on the build machine (2026-09-03, safe batch, developer mode, not elevated)
- Drive C: free space 2,033,340,416 -> 25,746,153,472 bytes (+22.08 GB); the run's own report counted
  21,319,077,118 bytes in 11m 31s over 11 sections, plus about 1.5 GB removed by an interrupted first pass.
- Per section: 1 package caches 12.16 GB (yarn v1 alone 10.8 GB in 340,734 files idle 100+ days), 6 editors
  4.30 GB (incl. two uninstalled `openai.chatgpt` extension leftovers, 1.95 GB), 10 user temp 3.35 GB, 8 apps
  0.92 GB, 7 browsers 0.46 GB (Edge + Brave), 9 Windows caches 87 MB, 2 build tools 40 MB, 3 and 21 nothing.
- Skipped by design and left to the owner: Chrome (open), Slack and Granola (open), Docker (daemon not running),
  every admin section (not elevated), hibernation (15.9 GB, admin) - rows in `docs/MANUAL-TASKS.md`.
- Protected spot-check before/after: `.ssh` (4 files, newest mtime), Documents (90 files, newest mtime),
  Desktop, AVDs (2), Gradle wrapper dists (2), Android SDK, installed VS Code extensions (16) all unchanged;
  extension folders went 18 -> 16, exactly the two leftovers.
- The first real pass exposed a hot-path defect: the per-file protection check cost 10.6 ms (path resolution
  for ~70 subtrees plus 50 wildcard compiles per call), so 400k yarn files would have taken over four hours.
  The pass was stopped (every deletion is atomic), `Get-ProtectionReason` was rewritten over pre-normalized
  prefixes and precompiled `WildcardPattern` objects (0.58 ms/call, identical verdicts on 35 probe paths,
  self-test guards green), and the run restarted. Keep the guard table-driven; never reintroduce per-call
  path resolution there.

## Release record
- 2026-09-03: `ac72188` (first commit, 72 files) and `70c6738` pushed to `main`; repo created public with
  `gh repo create`, Issues enabled, ruleset 22181256 "Protect main (PR + approval; owner bypass)" active
  (deletion, non-fast-forward, PR with 1 approval, required check `ci`; bypass = Repository admin). Direct
  owner pushes report `Bypassed rule violations for refs/heads/main` - expected, never `--force`/`--admin`.
- 2026-09-03T09:15:18Z: `windowsweep@1.0.0` published to npm by `aoneahsan` (37 files, 263,214 bytes
  unpacked); verified with `npm view` and `npx -y windowsweep@1.0.0 --version` from a fresh cache.
- Verify a published version from a directory OUTSIDE this repo: inside it, npx resolves the same-named local
  package and reports `'windowsweep' is not recognized` (`docs/troubleshooting.md`).

## Open material unknowns
- None.
